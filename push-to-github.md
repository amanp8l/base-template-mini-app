# Push to GitHub Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right → "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "ai-image-studio-mini-app")
4. Choose **Private** or **Public** (Private recommended for apps with API keys)
5. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect and Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Copy the repository URL and run:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual values
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Example (replace with your actual URL):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/ai-image-studio-mini-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
